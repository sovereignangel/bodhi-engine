The key instruction: do not transition from 'meditating' to 'not meditating.' Simply continue being aware as the activity happens. Awareness does not stop when you open your eyes or stand up. It is continuous, without gap. Practice noticing: there was never a moment when awareness was absent. The gap was imagined. Let this recognition become effortless — not something you maintain but something you notice is already the case."

      "text": "This month has been the heart of the entire curriculum — the pointing-out instructions through which awareness recognizes its own nature. From all three traditions, the essential point converges: Kadampa's vipashyana recognizes emptiness. Mahamudra's pointing-out recognizes awareness-itself. Integral practice ensures this recognition is developed alongside psychological maturity and carried into all dimensions of life. These are not three different things but three facets of one jewel.",
      "commentary": "The month ends not with a conclusion but with an ongoing invitation. Recognition is not a destination but a way of being. Tomorrow, the curriculum moves into the Four Yogas of Mahamudra — the systematic deepening and stabilization of what has been recognized this month. But the essence never changes: awareness, luminous and empty, recognizing itself, in this moment and every moment."

It is empty — there is nothing to find. It is unceasing — the display never stops. It is prior to time and space. It is not the observer but the knowing itself. Each thought self-liberates. Each experience is a wave in the ocean. There is no gap between meditation and life. Simply rest in this recognition. If you lose it, re-recognize. The recognition itself is the path, the practice, and the fruition. This is the heart of the pointing-out instructions. This is Mahamudra."
