The eight freedoms are freedom from birth as a hell being, a hungry ghost, an animal, a long-lived god, a barbarian in an uncivilized land, one with wrong views, born in a time without a Buddha's teaching, or born with impaired faculties that prevent receiving the Dharma.",
      "commentary": "Tsongkhapa begins the Lamrim by establishing that our current human life is extraordinarily rare and valuable. The eight freedoms describe the conditions from which we are currently free — each of which would make spiritual practice virtually impossible.

Both dimensions are necessary for full spiritual development. One can have profound state experiences at any developmental stage, and one can reach high developmental stages without deep state training.",

A practitioner can have genuine mystical experiences (state attainment) while still operating from an ethnocentric worldview (limited structure development), or can have a highly developed worldcentric perspective while lacking any contemplative depth.
