It attacks the concept of inherent production — the idea that causation is an intrinsic, self-powered process.

Yet production still occurs conventionally: seeds still produce sprouts. The refutation targets only the inherent, self-powered quality we project onto causation."

      "text": "DiPerna's integral framework situates emptiness within three essential dimensions of spiritual development: waking up (direct realization of emptiness), growing up (developing the cognitive, moral, and interpersonal structures to hold the realization), and cleaning up (integrating shadow material so the realization is not co-opted by unconscious patterns). All three are necessary for mature, embodied wisdom.",
      "commentary": "This teaching synthesizes the month's themes. The Kadampa tradition excels at the philosophical precision needed for waking up — correct view, rigorous analysis, direct realization. The Mahamudra tradition excels at the experiential depth of waking up — direct recognition of awareness's nature. The integral framework contributes the crucial insight that waking up alone is insufficient. Without growing up and cleaning up, even genuine emptiness realization can be limited, distorted, or weaponized. The full path includes all three dimensions."

In the final seven minutes, hold all three dimensions at once: the spaciousness of emptiness, the appreciation of development, and the honesty about what remains unresolved.

Tsongkhapa insists that understanding emptiness must strengthen, not undermine, ethical conduct. Brown teaches that Mahamudra realization transforms how one engages with every moment.

Brown teaches that Mahamudra realization naturally expresses as compassionate action. DiPerna insists that the developmental structure through which emptiness is realized determines whether it enhances or undermines ethical sensitivity.
