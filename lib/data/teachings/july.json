      "method": "Begin with five minutes of calm abiding. Then generate bodhicitta: 'For all beings, I shall attain enlightenment.' Now, with bodhicitta alive in your heart, begin to imagine your upcoming day. Visualize each interaction you will have — morning routines, work encounters, family moments, encounters with strangers. With each, generate the intention: 'May this interaction benefit this being.' See every person as your former mother. Feel compassion for their suffering. Wish them happiness. Commit to making each moment an expression of bodhicitta. Carry this intention as you close your meditation and open your eyes."
