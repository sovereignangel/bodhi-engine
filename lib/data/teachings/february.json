Each perception, each thought, each sensation is a distinct event with its own arising, briefly staying, and cessation.",

The daily practice of remembering death is the Kadampa memento mori.",

Let the answers arise naturally. Then make three resolves: one thing I will do today because it truly matters; one thing I will not waste time on because death reminds me it is trivial; one person I will express love or gratitude to because there may not be another chance.

Finally, the Integral view: recognize that your very understanding of impermanence has evolved and will continue to evolve. You are impermanence understanding itself. Now let all three perspectives merge into a single integrated awareness. Change is not threatening — it is the medium in which you live, grow, practice, and awaken. Rest in this embrace of change.

Does the grudge seem worth it from the perspective of death? Let impermanence soften the edges. Finally, bring to mind a casual acquaintance — someone you barely notice. They too will die.
