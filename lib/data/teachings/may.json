      "method": "Begin with ten minutes of standard shamatha on the breath. Then spend five minutes consciously holding multiple perspectives on what you are doing. See this practice as relaxation (feel the body releasing tension). See it as concentration training (notice the mind becoming more focused). See it as event-recognition (notice each breath as a discrete event). See it as awareness recognizing itself (notice what knows each event). Do not choose between these perspectives — hold them all simultaneously, or let them rotate like facets of a jewel. For the final ten minutes, release all frameworks and simply sit. Let the practice be whatever it is, beyond any description."

You have practiced placing attention, sustaining attention, diagnosing faults, applying antidotes, recognizing laxity, releasing effort, and glimpsing the awareness that knows each breath-event.",
      "commentary": "The journey of shamatha is not linear — it is a spiral. Each time you sit, you re-encounter placement, distraction, and return. But the quality of your sitting has changed. The mind that began this month is not the mind that finishes it. Something has shifted in how you relate to stillness."

Then five minutes of Brown's event perspective — letting each breath arise as a discrete event, receiving rather than searching. Then five minutes of effortless awareness — releasing effort and letting awareness know the breath naturally. Then five minutes of the awareness inquiry — noticing not just the breath but what knows the breath. Then five minutes of multi-perspectival sitting — holding all frameworks simultaneously. For the final five minutes, release everything — all techniques, all frameworks, all effort — and simply sit as awareness in the present moment. Dedicate the merit of this month's practice to all beings who seek peace of mind."
