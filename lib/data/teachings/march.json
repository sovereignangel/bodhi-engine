      "method": "Begin with breath awareness. Then contemplate the Kadampa view: karma is definite, it increases, you do not experience effects of uncommitted actions, and actions are never lost. Feel the gravity and precision of this. Now shift to the Mahamudra view: in the nature of mind, karma is like writing on water — vivid but self-liberating when recognized. Feel the spaciousness of this. Now include the integral view: karma operates at personal, collective, and systemic levels, and understanding deepens with development. Hold all three perspectives simultaneously. Rest in the ethical ground they collectively provide."

      "text": "This month has been titled 'Finding Ground' because refuge and karma together constitute the ethical foundation upon which the entire path is built. Refuge provides orientation — we know where we are going and who guides us. Karma provides accountability — we understand that every action matters and shapes our journey. With this ground firmly established, we are prepared for whatever comes next on the path. The foundation is not merely a beginning to be left behind but a living reality that deepens with every stage of practice.",
      "commentary": "As Tsongkhapa teaches, the foundational practices are not elementary in the sense of being simple or dispensable. They are foundational in the sense of being essential at every stage. Even the most advanced practitioner takes refuge and guards karma. The ground does not disappear — it deepens."

      "method": "This is the capstone meditation for the month. Begin with five minutes of calm abiding, settling deeply into the present moment. Then take refuge in the Three Jewels, feeling their support and guidance. Take inner refuge in your own buddha-nature, feeling its luminous presence. Take refuge in the lineage, feeling the blessings of transmission. Contemplate karma: the preciousness of this human life with its ethical choices, the responsibility and the freedom inherent in each moment. Now let all of these dissolve into a single, integrated experience of being grounded — ethically, spiritually, and experientially. Rest in this ground for the remainder of the session. Know that this ground will carry you forward into whatever comes next."
