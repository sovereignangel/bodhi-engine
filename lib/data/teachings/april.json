Practice this clear seeing with several objects of desire. Then rest in the clarity that remains when the projections dissolve."

These are often signals of shadow material. Choose one and bring it into awareness without judgment. Sit with the discomfort. Ask: where does this live in my body? How old does this feeling seem? Is there a version of me that I have disowned? This is not psychotherapy but contemplative shadow work: using meditative awareness to illuminate what is usually hidden. The renunciation here is renouncing the avoidance of our own darkness. Close by offering compassion to whatever you have uncovered."

      "method": "This integrative session draws from all three traditions. Begin with five minutes of Kadampa-style analytical contemplation on suffering. Then transition to five minutes of Mahamudra-style concentration, using the motivation generated by the contemplation to fuel single-pointed attention. Then spend five minutes in Integral-style awareness, noticing which developmental lens you are viewing from and whether shadow material is present. In the final ten minutes, let all frameworks dissolve and simply rest in the genuine motivation for liberation that has been cultivated. Feel it in your heart. Let it be the simple truth of your practice: you wish to be free, and you wish all beings to be free. This is the engine that will carry you through the path ahead."

      "text": "As the month of renunciation concludes, the practitioner consolidates what has been cultivated. Renunciation is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing orientation that deepens throughout the path. It is the engine that powers concentration training, the ground of compassion for others still caught in samsara, and the clear seeing that makes wisdom possible. From this point forward, every practice is infused with the energy of definite emergence.",
      "commentary": "This consolidation marks the transition from the contemplation of suffering to the active training of the mind. The practitioner who has genuinely developed renunciation is now ready for the concentration practices of the next month, not as a technique to be mastered but as a natural response to the deeply felt need for liberation."

Then spend five minutes reviewing the entire arc of this month: the three sufferings, the six realms, the twelve links, the meaning of true renunciation, the integral dimensions, the movement from understanding to heartfelt resolve. Let each teaching arise briefly and settle into the body. Now spend ten minutes simply resting in the quality of renunciation itself: that clear, warm, determined energy that says 'I will be free, and I will help others be free.' Feel it as a stable presence rather than a passing emotion. In the final five to ten minutes, look forward to the path ahead. The concentration practices are coming. Feel how renunciation naturally generates enthusiasm for this training. Dedicate the merit of this entire month to the liberation of all sentient beings."
